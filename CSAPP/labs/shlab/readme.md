This lab is unsolved, because I have spend so much time on it.</br>
As there are a critical question that I can't deal with.</br>
Is that how could I use signal after calling execve() ? </br>
I have google this questions and their say that I should use sigtaction()</br>
instead of using signal(). And that's what the handout does.</br>
But the key point is how should I use sigtaction correctly.</br>
The textbook doesn't tell me anything about this funcition.</br>
I have tried so many times but all failed. So, I would get up it before I have go</br>
further on linux programming. I would come back to solve this problems one day...</br>
