***********************************************</br>
It's so hard to solve all problems on this lab.</br>
I spend more than 3 days to solve the problems as well as build a linux environment.</br>
</br>
You can simply get all the problem's disassmblies form here and try to solve it by youself.</br>
ofc you should omit my comments, though it may won't help you much :) </br>
Nonetheless, I'm highly recommand that you should build a linux and try it by yourself.</br>
